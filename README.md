About the development 🛠️
The development of this project was quite challenging. I dedicated a lot of time to make it as faithful as possible to the original design. I didn't want my final project of the HTML and CSS module to be “half-baked,” so I spent a lot of time fine-tuning every detail—every animation, transition, and responsiveness. I did my best to make it as pleasant as possible, ensuring a great user experience while navigating the page.

Honestly, I’m really satisfied with the result of this project. All the effort paid off in the end.

So don’t be afraid to explore this project to its fullest—every animation and screen size behavior was carefully planned to work perfectly.
